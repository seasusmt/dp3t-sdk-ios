## DP3T
The Decentralised Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-3T) project is an open protocol for COVID-19 proximity tracing using Bluetooth Low Energy functionality on mobile devices that ensures personal data and computation stays entirely on an individual's phone. It was produced by a core team of over 25 scientists and academic researchers from across Europe. It has also been scrutinized and improved by the wider community.

DP-3T is a free-standing effort started at EPFL and ETHZ that produced this protocol and that is implementing it in an open-sourced app and server.


## Introduction
CovidAlertMT is a COVID-19 tracing client based on the official COVID-19 tracing solution for Switzerland, with changes and optimisations to accommodate Maltese requirements. This SDK fork was developed solely for use with the main Maltese app and may or may not work as a standalone project.
